# Extensive Test Trace for OoO RISC-V Processor

# 1. Initialization
# x1 = Base Address (0), x2 = 10, x3 = 20
0x00: ADDI x1, x0, 0        # x1 = 0
0x04: ADDI x2, x0, 10       # x2 = 10
0x08: ADDI x3, x0, 20       # x3 = 20

# 2. ALU Dependency Chain (RAW Hazards)
# x4 should become 30, x5 should become 20
0x0C: ADD x4, x2, x3        # x4 = 10 + 20 = 30
0x10: SUB x5, x4, x2        # x5 = 30 - 10 = 20

# 3. Memory Operations & Word Forwarding
# Store 30 to address 0, then Load it back to x6
0x14: SW x4, 0(x1)          # Mem[0] = 30
0x18: LW x6, 0(x1)          # x6 = 30 (Checks Store->Load forwarding)

# 4. Load-Use Hazard
# Dependent ALU instruction immediately follows Load
0x1C: ADD x7, x6, x2        # x7 = 30 + 10 = 40 (Must wait for LW)

# 5. Sub-word Memory Access
# Store 0xFF (255) to address 4, Load it back as byte
0x20: ADDI x8, x0, 255      # x8 = 0xFF
0x24: SB x8, 4(x1)          # Mem[4] = 0xFF (Byte store)
0x28: LBU x9, 4(x1)         # x9 = 255 (Unsigned byte load)

# 6. Control Flow: Loop
# Decrement x10 from 2 to 0. Loop takes 2 iterations.
0x2C: ADDI x10, x0, 2       # x10 = 2
# Loop Label:
0x30: ADDI x10, x10, -1     # Decrement
0x34: BNE x10, x0, -4       # Branch back to 0x30 if x10 != 0

# 7. Unconditional Jump
# Skip the "BAD" instruction
0x38: JAL x0, 8             # Jump to 0x40 (PC+8)
0x3C: ADDI x11, x0, 1       # DEAD CODE (Should not commit)
0x40: ADDI x12, x0, 2       # x12 = 2 (Target of JAL)
